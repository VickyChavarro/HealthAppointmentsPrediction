- The project's objective was to predict the final status of medical appointments for a health company located in Bogot√°, with the aim of reducing costs associated with missed and cancelled appointments. The analysis was conducted using a database comprising 67,650 medical appointment records from July to November 2013, along with an additional set of 16,864 appointments from November to December, whose statuses were to be predicted.

- The primary purpose of the study was to develop a predictive model capable of accurately classifying the final appointment statuses, with particular emphasis on missed appointments, which constituted the most significant cost for the company. Consequently, the evaluation metric employed was a weighted F score, which prioritised the ranking of missed and cancelled appointments over kept appointments. This approach reflected the operational importance of minimising missed appointments and managing cancellations efficiently.

- During the modelling phase, a range of supervised learning algorithms were evaluated for their capacity to predict the final status of appointments. These included decision trees, Random Forest, and ensemble models such as XGBoost. The selection of these models was based on their capacity to process both categorical and numerical data, in addition to their efficacy in classification tasks.
  
- The final model selected achieved good classification accuracy, with a weighted F score that especially excelled in predicting missed appointments, the priority objective of the project.
  
- This project not only provided a valuable predictive tool for the healthcare company, but also demonstrated how the integration of supervised learning techniques and the CRISP-DM methodology can effectively address critical operational problems. The results obtained can help the company improve resource allocation, reduce financial losses and optimise the patient experience by proactively managing medical appointments.
